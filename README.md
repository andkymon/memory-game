# 🐱 Memory Game: Cat Edition

A fun little memory game built with React! Click on a cat only once — if you click the same cat twice, the game resets. Try to get the highest score possible!

I made this project to practice and improve my React skills — particularly in managing props and state, using useEffect for API calls, and working with external data.
